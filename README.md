# Countries-Info-Android

Suppose that you have a folder in internal storage of your phone. The folder name is **Resources**
and is located in **Download** folder of your phone’s internal storage. This folder further contains
3 folders as following:

### 1. Country Names:

This folder contains a text file (names.txt) having some country names e.g., Pakistan, Afghanistan etc. each country name is comma separated.

### 2. Country Flags:

This Folder contains images of flags of countries mentioned in names.txt file. The images are named with country name i.e., Pakistan.jpg, America.jpg etc. No. of countries in Names.txt are equal to no. flags in this folder.

### 3. Country Description:

This folder contains multiple .txt files and each file represent the details of a unique country. For example, a file Pakistan.txt contains all basic information of Pakistan e.g., where is county is located, total population of the country, total area of the country etc.

---

## Project Description:

* Designed a mobile application that shows a list of all countries in Names.txt using a well-designed ListView. When user clicks on any country, the app shows description of the country (it reads the description from the relevant file and folder) along with its flag i.e. Flag is shown along with the details.

* If user long clicks any country in main list of countries (i.e. on main activity), app prompts the user to confirm if user wants to delete this country from list as well as all relevant files. For example, if a user long clicks on India, app shows a confirmation message "Are you sure you want to delete India?". If user clicks on “Yes”, all details of India are deleted from internal storage i.e. its flag(India.jpg), its description (India.txt), and “India” from names.txt also gets deleted from
internal storage.
